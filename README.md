# COMP 163 - Project 1: Character Creator & Chronicles
# ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

Build a text-based RPG character creation and story progression system that demonstrates mastery of functions and file I/O operations.

# Required Functions 
Complete these functions in project1_starter.py:

create_character(name, character_class) - Create new character

calculate_stats(character_class, level) - Calculate character stats

save_character(character, filename) - Save character to file

load_character(filename) - Load character from file

display_character(character) - Display character info

level_up(character) - Increase character level

# Game Concept
A/your character awakes and roams the world. Having lost your memory you are to traverse the world to find a purpose. Whether that is to become a hero, villain, or a simple farmer is up to you.

# Design Choices
I added modifiers to stat progression as they level up based on the base stats of the character. If the stat starts high that state will grow the largest out of a medium and low base stat. 
Example:
A warrior will naturally level up their strength and health stats faster than a mage who has low strength and health.

# Bonus Creative Features
Besides the modifications based on the character class I didn't add any very creative features.

# AI Usage
I used AI to help explain the errors I was running into and with understanding where I should start in forming the functions. There are a few steps where I did use code from Google Gemini. I have added comments above said code. 

# How to Run
Upon being saved as a Python file open it into an IDE and use the if__name__=="__main__": block.
You can then go through and call the functions creating, saving, and loading a character while also calculating the stats as your character levels up.
